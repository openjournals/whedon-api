It looks like you don't have a manager and tester assigned yet so I can't start the test. Try one or more of these commands:

```
# Change managerial assignment
@roboneuro assign @username as manager

# Assign a GitHub user as the sole tester of this submission
@roboneuro assign @username as tester

# Add a GitHub user to the testers of this submission
@roboneuro add @username as tester
```
