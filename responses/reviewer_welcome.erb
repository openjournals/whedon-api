Hello human, I'm @whedon. I'm here to help you with some common editorial tasks. <%= reviewer %> it looks like you're currently assigned as the reviewer for this paper :tada:.

If you haven't already, you should seriously consider unsubscribing from GitHub notifications for this (https://github.com/<%= nwo %>) repository. As as reviewer, you're probably currently watching this repository which means for GitHub's default behaviour you will receive notifications (emails) for all reviews ðŸ˜¿

To fix this do the following two things:

1. Set yourself as 'Not watching' https://github.com/<%= nwo %>:
